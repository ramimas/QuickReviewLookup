# QuickReviewLookup

A simple CLI program that allows a user to search through thousands of Netflix movie reviews and ratings.<br />The main challenge of this program was implementing an efficient way to parse and organize the enormous data sets.<br />This was done with the help of several (C++ 11) enhancements, including the std::vector and std::map data structures.<br />
Similar Netflix data sets can be found on Kaggle.com<br />

Program starts out displaying the top 10 movies based on review average.
